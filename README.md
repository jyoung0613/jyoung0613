### Hi I am John ðŸ‘‹

I am a Junior Software Developer leveraging accounts payable and operational management background to build better workflow applications. Recently finished the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, Node.js, & MVC Framework design. MERN stacks! I love knowledge and I love to be challenged when working. I believe that personal growth comes through these times of challenge, and I look forward to that growth. Each project I work on just furthers that search for knowledge and betters not only everything I work on, but also my life. I recently worked on a project to build an intuitive website marketplace for the sale of electronic items. I worked in a group of 5 to develop this multi-page site to allow users the access to generate item listings with full details of the product and its cost. I am excited to leverage my recently acquired skills along with my years of work as an accounts payable operations manager.
